                  Computing is being transformed to a model consisting of services that are delivered in a manner similar to utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and telephony. In such a model, users access services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted or how they are delivered. Cloud computing paradigm has turned this vision of "computing utilities" into a reality. It offers infrastructure, platform, and software as services, which are made available to consumers as subscription-oriented services. Cloud application platforms need to offer (1) APIs and tools for rapid creation of elastic applications and (2) a runtime system for deployment of applications on geographically distributed Data Centre infrastructures (with Quantum computing nodes) in a seamless manner.
                  <br><br>
                  The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm enables seamless integration of cyber-and-physical worlds and opening opportunities for creating new class of applications for domains such as smart cities, smart robotics, and smart healthcare. The emerging Fog/Edge computing paradigms support latency sensitive/real-time IoT applications with a seamless integration of network-wide resources all the way from edge to the Cloud.
                  <br><br>
                  This keynote presentation will cover (a) 21st century vision of computing and identifies various IT paradigms promising to deliver the vision of computing utilities; (b) innovative architecture 
                  for creating elastic Clouds integrating edge resources and managed Clouds, (c) Aneka 5G, a Cloud Application Platform, for rapid development of Cloud/Big Data/AI applications and their deployment on private/public Clouds with resource provisioning driven by SLAs, (d) a novel FogBus software framework with Blockchain-based data-integrity management for facilitating end-to-end IoT-Fog/Edge-Cloud integration for execution of sensitive IoT applications, (e) experimental results on deploying Cloud and Big Data/ IoT applications in engineering, and health care (e.g., COVID-19), deep learning/Artificial intelligence (AI), satellite image processing, and natural language processing (mining COVID-19 research for new insights) on elastic Clouds, (f) QFaaS: A Serverless Function-as-a-Service Framework for Quantum Computing, and (g) directions for delivering our 21st century vision along with new directions for future research in Cloud, Edge, and Quantum computing.

                  In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the demand for Big Data to be processed on-the-fly for analytics, a paradigm shift that allows for immediate insights and accelerated decision-making. However, this advancement comes with its own set of challenges, particularly for data continuously acquired at the edge, where distributed compute capacity constraints and memory limitations pose a hurdle in matching the data velocity, potentially resulting in loss of information.
                  <br><br>
                  In this presentation, I will delve into these challenges, focusing on quality-of-service trade-offs that come when engineering distributed data processing systems based on deep learning. I will explore dynamic neural architectures based on early-exit to accelerate data processing. I will also propose a novel class of surrogate models to reason about data throughouts and data loss, explaining how they can be integrated into system design to enhance quality assurance.

                  The world around us is becoming smart with the emergence of Smart Objects and the adoption of Industry 4.0. Smart World is made of SmartX objects like Smart Car, Smart Transport, Smart Hospital, Smart Farming, Smart City, Smart Home, Smart Energy, and so on, driven by augmented, virtual reality, and autonomous IoT (Internet of Things). The goal of Smart World is to enhance quality of life, reduce resource consumption, ensure sustainability, and foster innovation through intelligent automation and data-driven decision-making. This will be realized through the convergence of AI, 6G, Digital Twins, and Digital Triplets. This talk will present how AI, 6G and Cognitive Graphs are converging to realize the Smart World. It will cover various aspects of AI – Symbolic AI, Subsymbolic AI, Causal & Counterfactual AI, and Generative AI. This talk will introduce SmartX, Smart World, Industry 4.0, Digital Twins, Digital Triplets, and the Autonomous Systems. To automate any system, the processes within the system must be fully understood. In this regard, we will also introduce the technique of process mining, and methodologies of how to construct a Finite State Autonomous System.
